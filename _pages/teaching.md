Current natural language processing (NLP) models (e.g. ChatGPT, GPT-4, etc.) have impressive capabilities, but how closely do they actually align with the capabilities of the only system that truly understands complex language--the human brain? In this seminar, we will review work that studies the existing alignment between the representations of language constructed by NLP models and the representations of language in the human brain obtained from brain imaging devices, as humans and models process the same language input. We will discuss the reasons for existing alignment, and some of the established remaining gaps. We will additionally review works that aim to bring NLP models closer to the human brain. Lastly, students will have the opportunity to propose and complete related projects.

## Course structure

The course consists of five main components that contribute to the final grade as follows: 
  1. Attendence and participation during class (20%)
  2. Presentations and reports of research papers: one presentation (10%) and two reports (10%) for each student.
  3. Project proposal (20%)
  4. Project report and code (20%)
  5. Final presentation (20%)

### Introductory lectures
At the start of the course, we will begin with two classes. These introductory sessions aim to familiarize students with fundamental concepts in neuroscience and the principles behind encoding models. During these initial lessons, our primary objective is to provide students with a solid foundation in basic neuroscientific principles and the understanding of encoding models used in the field.

### Research paper presentations and reports
In the course of the entire semester, there will be **two** days dedicated to student presentations of research papers. Each presentation will have a duration of 20 minutes, followed by a 20-minute discussion. Half of the class will be responsible for delivering oral presentations, while the remaining half will be tasked with submitting two written reports on research papers (2-page utilizing the [NeurIPS template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/neurips-2021-ai-for-science-workshop/mqdhgfxfxkgn)). 

Structure the presentation/report as follows:
  - a short summary of the paper
  - a discussion on how the paper extends state of the art
  - the main strengths of the paper.
  - the main weaknesses of the paper
  - discuss how this paper could be improved.
If you wish, you could also use these ideas to pursue as part of your project.

### Project proposal
Students will have the freedom to pursue a project of their choice. To begin, each student will submit project proposals. The project could be related to the seminar papers, or it could also be new directions you are most excited about. Based on your project proposals and discussions a concrete project will be picked. 

### Project report
You will have to submit a report (no page limits utilizing the [NeurIPS template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/neurips-2021-ai-for-science-workshop/mqdhgfxfxkgn)) and executable code for the project. Each student will work on the project separately (no teams).

### Final project presentation
You will have to prepare a presentation of 20 mins. Your presentation will be based on the project, along with any relevant papers related to your project.

## Timeline
Each lecture or presentation will take place on Tuesdays in room E15 005. Attendance in person is mandatory, but in cases where students are unable to attend the classes in person, they can also participate remotely via [Zoom](http://...).
